For a hint on how these exercises will use HTML inside of a normal JS string to create content, consider the following string:

var contentString = "This<br>is<br>example<br>code";

Now run the following line of code. Notice that the browser will render the <br> tags and make them behave like HTML.

document.body.innerHTML += contentString;
